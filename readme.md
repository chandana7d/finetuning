# Training Models Faster with PEFT ðŸš€

**PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)** enables to train models faster and more efficiently. By optimizing memory usage, computational resources, and cost, PEFT achieves high performance without unnecessary overhead.

## Key Benefits:
- ðŸš„ **2-5X Faster Training**: Reduce training time with parameter-efficient techniques.
- ðŸ’¾ **Optimized Memory Usage**: Utilize fewer resources while maintaining performance.
- ðŸ’° **Lower Computational Costs**: Save on infrastructure expenses with efficient computation.

## About PEFT
PEFT focuses on fine-tuning only the necessary parameters of a model, efficient training without retraining the entire model.
